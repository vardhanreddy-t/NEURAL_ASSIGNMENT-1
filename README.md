Neural Network Assignment ICP_1 programs in this assignment , the below concepts are covered
* string concation
* counting
* input and output file read and write concept
* lists and neseseted comprehensions
  
1)Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to fullname function that should return the (full name). o For example: ▪ First_name = “your first name”, last_name = “your last name” ▪ Full_name = “your full name” o Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string. Str = “Good evening” Output: Go vnn

SOLUTION: Entering the first name and last name form the user and combining these values into the fullname and then displaying the fullname.
  For string alteration it will take the fullname from the function and then returns the alternative values by using the slicing operator.
  
2)Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output. o Finally store the output in output.txt file. Example: Input: a file includes two lines: Python Course Deep Learning Course Output: Python Course Deep Learning Course Word_Count: Python: 1 Course: 2 Deep: 1 Learning: 1

SOLUTION:opening the file by using the open() function and giving tha path of the files of both input and output files.
Then reading the file by using the readlines() function and writing the data by using writelines() function then splitting the sentance by using the split() function and then separting then printing the words.

3)Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
Nested Interactive loop.
List comprehensions

SOLUTION:using list for declaring the values and then appending the values then using the for loop an d then list comphersion
